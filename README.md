# Redbrick Airdrop Bot

ðŸš€ **Redbrick Airdrop Bot** ðŸš€ is an automation tool created for managing airdrop tasks on the Redbrick platform. The bot supports both manual and automatic modes for daily logins, level-ups, and task completions.

## Features

- **Manual Mode:** Perform tasks like daily login, level-ups, and task completions on-demand.
- **Automatic Mode:** Schedule tasks to run daily at midnight.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Make sure Node.js is installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Axios:** HTTP client for making requests.
- **Cron:** For scheduling automatic tasks.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dante4rt/redbrick-airdrop-bot.git
    cd redbrick-airdrop-bot
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

    - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

      ```bash
      cp .env.example .env
      ```

    - Obtain your `BEARER` and `TOKEN` values. These can typically be found in your browserâ€™s local storage or session storage when youâ€™re logged into the Redbrick platform. Look for keys related to authentication, such as `token` or `auth`.

    - Open `.env` and paste your values:

      ```env
      BEARER=your_bearer_token_here
      TOKEN=your_token_query_here
      ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Bot:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

2. **Follow the Prompts:**

    - Choose between `Default Flow` or `Automatic Flow`.
    - In `Default Flow`, you can select actions like daily login, level-up, or task completion.
    - In `Automatic Flow`, tasks will be scheduled to run daily at midnight.
